              The main aim of our website is to test your skills in front-end langauges.<br><br>
              The HTML, CSS and JavaScript online test assesses candidates knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as their ability to utilize JavaScript to manipulate Document Object Model built from HTML and CSS.
              It's an ideal test for pre-employment screening. A good front-end developer should be able to utilize all these technologies to create a modern, dynamic, and interactive user interface.<br><br>
